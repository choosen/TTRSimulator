`TODO.list` has my future ideas.

You can enter your full setup 
by leaving color inputs and paste numbers values in new lines.

Hit setup to open new window with same color set.

BUGS:
1. OK STATUS is not splitting colors right into any color tracks
1. OK STATUS is not checking at all dual colors tracks
