- [done, focus outside the inputs] paste
  - indicate clipboard option to setup [only in readme for now.. cannot paste in mobiles ;/]

- spin of this project: interactive map of tickets (cities or highliting shortest path)
- list completed tracks (for opps moves analysis, or to draw or not tix in last move)

- add ''remaining'' column to helper (multiple multicolors can use not optimized locos #, so I put `?` close to locos left when multiple multicolors)
  - missing: pick up best result of verifications by counting used locos
  - bug: multi color tracks  cause displaying wrong Left colors column
