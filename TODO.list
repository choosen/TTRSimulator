- [done, focus outside the inputs] paste
  - indicate clipboard option to setup [only in readme for now..]
- spin of this project: interactive map of tickets (cities or highliting shortest path)
- list completed tracks (for opps moves analysis, or to draw or not tix in last move)
- [Partly completed] choose color on double color routes (My idea is to do it in Helper only, to make faster the route planning experience itself)
  - missing: handling to choose the only 1 of 2,3 routes with same color combo (only for blue/white orange/black red/yellow)
- add ''remaining'' column to helper (multiple multicolors can use not optimized locos #, so I put `?` close to locos left when multiple multicolors)
  - missing: pick up best result of verifications by counting used locos
